Simple Proxy Server 

two file the first one ProxyServer.java is to create the new java threads.
In the ProxyServer
    There is a ServerSocket which is response to create threads with socket 
    The log file writer function which synchonized with the threads.
In the ProxyThreads class
 -This class extends the java thread class and override the run function.
 Here I used two client sockets classes; 
    1 response for the connection with the bowser 
        with port 3333(the bowser should be configured for this port)
    The other one for connection with the internet.    
I used steps
    -read the GET http request from the user using inputstram of the browser socket
    -extact the host and file name from the reequest using java string manipulation 
    -create a  internet scocket with the host name and port 80
    -send the htttp request to the internet manually using the internet socket outputstream.
    -and write back the response to the browser using the browser socket outstream.
    -log a measse according to the request and response.
